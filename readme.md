[![Delivering Technical Pitches - Lessons from the trenches](source/_static/logo.png)](https://rajatpandit.com/delivering-technical-pitches/)

Running a pre-sales team means a lot of time spent in coaching the customer engineering team in presenting the proposition to potential customers. Over the years I have seen the pitches being done very well and some not so well. This is an attempt opensource and document some ideas to keep in mind as you work and sharpen your pitches - having said that - there are also ideas in there to landing a new way at looking at a problem statement, story telling - making for a retable enagagement with your stakeholders.

Feedback is always welcome welcome, please suggest edits, changes or collab requests via PR - credits will be added to the credits section as well
